## What's the Omnibar?

The Omnibar is the black bar next to your user profile image at the top of your stream, and you use it to post things on Ello. You can also use the Omnibar to mention others in your posts, to comment on other people's posts, and very shortly, to send private message to your friends.

## How do I use the Omnibar?

1. You can put just about anything in the Omnibar. Here are some things you can do:

2. Type, cut, paste & format text.

3. Drag & drop image files, including .JPG, .GIF, animated .GIF, and .PNG files.

4. Select an image from your computer by clicking the browse files icon within the omnibar modal.

5. Mention other Ello users by adding an `@` symbol in front of their username. For example, @budnitzbicycles or @bergerfohr. The Omnibar background will turn yellow when Ello recognizes that you have mentioned another user in your post.

6. Create links by highlighting text in the Omnibar and clicking the arrow icon.

7. Embed video files by entering a Youtube, Vimeo, or DailyMotion URL link directly into the Omnibar.

8. Embed audio files by entering a Soundcloud or Mixcloud URL link directly into the Omnibar.

9. Use the keyboard shortcut command + enter/return (Mac) or control + enter (Windows) to submit your post.
