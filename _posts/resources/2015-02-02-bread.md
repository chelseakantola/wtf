Many of our users have begun using the loaf of bread emoji in comments when they like something: :bread:

You can create the loaf of bread by typing:

{% comment %}
A known issue that doesn’t seem like it will get fixed until Jekyll 2.0
prevents us from _not_ rendering an emoji image tag inside a code block
(https://github.com/jekyll/jemoji/issues/12)

This is the work-around.
{% endcomment %}

`{{ '&#58;bread&#58;' | markdownify | strip_html }}`

Other ad-based social networks make money if you “like” lots of things. Each time you do, they record what you like. The more they know about you, the more money they make when they sell your data to advertisers.

Because Ello doesn’t have ads, we’re not motivated to do anything like that.

Of course there’s nothing wrong with a quick “like”! But on Ello, but we also love the idea of moving away from “counting likes” and “collecting as many followers as possible”.

Ello is about quality, not quantity.

That said, we have something coming in a more “Ello” way — stay tuned.
